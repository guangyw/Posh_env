# Posh-Env - PowerShell Environment

PowerShell configurations and scripts for both work and home.

## TODOs

- oPsStart should work for all enlistment (sd client)

- Define client specific settings in separate config files

> Should have a separate file to define common utilities for all
> Have a separate file to define common utilities for all Office enlistments

- Environment switch - e.g. Visual Studio Build Environment
> Use something as: Enter-VsEnv, Exit-VsEnv

- PsEnvCheck for comprehensive environment setup check
- autojump replacement
