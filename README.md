# Posh-Env - PowerShell Environment

PowerShell configurations and scripts for both work and home.

## TODOs

- nPsStart should work for all enlistment (sd client)

- Define client specific settings in separate config files

- Merge the scripts you used at home to bootstrap a common PS environment

> The common part should be: General environment values (fsharp, PsReadline, Python)
> Should have a separate file to define common utilities for all
> Have a separate file to define common utilities for all Office enlistments

- Environment swtich - e.g. Visual Studio Build Environment
