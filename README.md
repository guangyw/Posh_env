# Posh-Env - PowerShell Environment

PowerShell configurations and scripts for both work and play.

## TODOs

- Environment switch - e.g. Visual Studio Build Environment
> Use something as: Enter-VsEnv, Exit-VsEnv
> Environment will need to be stacked upon each other

- PsEnvCheck for comprehensive environment setup check

# DONEs

- oPsStart should work for all enlistment (sd client)

- Define client specific settings in separate config files
Comment: there should hardly be any client specific settings
         for now let's use env xml to store the customization

- Should have a separate file to define common utilities for all
- Have a separate file to define common utilities for all Office enlistments

- autojump replacement (Using Z-Location for now)
