# PsEnv - PowerShell Environment

PowerShell configurations and scripts for both work and play.

## TODOs

- Auto environment switch as you change directory (?)
  > Use something as: Posh-Env, Pop-Env

- Environment switch - e.g. Visual Studio Build Environment
  > Environment will need to be stacked upon each other
  > Switch-Environment OLS-GIT
  > (If it's cheap to init, it should be cheap to switch)

// Nice to have, maybe too much
- PsEnvCheck for comprehensive environment setup check
- Environment viewer and diagnostics
- Environment diff

- Create environment for PsEnv itself for developing and testing
- Respect ConEmu palette configs
